## Thoughts on CS Education
This section can be written inline or linked to another page. Why motivated you to become a K12 Computer Science Teacher? Should the subject be taught on its own or integrated in other subjects? What CS is important for everybody?

Depending on your personal background and goals this section should be somewhat unique. This is an opportunity to tell a story - paint a picture as to the educator you intend to be.

As this section will be unique and personal, it is recommended that you talk possibilities over with both your cohort members and also with the program director/advisor.

## What you can teach
Since many computer science programs are in their infancy, you will be at an advantage when applying to programs if you are qualified to teach classes beyond CS classes. To this end, make sure to list the classes and/or subjects you are qualified to teach.

All Hunter CS Education student are qualified to teach any CS class but it is worth explicitly listing APCS-Principles and APCS-A. Depending on your individual background you might list something like "High School Mathematics" or even more specifically "Calculus" or possible other subjects.

## Sample lesson plan or plans
Make sure to include one or two sample lesson plans. These can be PDF files, Markdown files or any other format that's convenient for a potential employer.

If you were able to teach from this lesson plan as part of your student teaching or fieldwork experiences, it could be helpful to include a few thoughts on the implementation and how it went.

## Curricular Unit
You can most easily adapt your Curriculum Development project for this section. Edit or create a README.md file to describe the unit and link to the files in your currdev repo and then add a link and brief description in your portfolio site.

## CS project or projects
This can be most easily done by linking to either your full GitHub profile but it would probably be better to highlight specific projects and only provide links to those. For each of those, make sure to update their README.md files to explain the individual repo or repos.
