      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California. I have 3 older siblings. Their personalities and stories are unique and interesting! I can talk forever about them, but this page isn't about them. I grew up caught between a wealthy white neighborhood and a poorer Chinese community. As a child, I was very active and participated in a lot of activities. I did gymnastics, cheerleading, piano, Girl Scouts, and volunteer work. I was very active in my church (though ironically, my parents are atheist/agnostic).</p>

      <p>When I was a senior to college, I wanted to go to a public California school, like my 3 older siblings. Unfortunately (or rather, because of my procrastination...) I got rejected from all of my schools (even my safety schools!).... except for NYU! So I had no choice but to pay lots of money to go to college.</p>

      <p>When I was 17, I moved to NYC by myself. The day I moved to New York, Hurricane Irene hit! I ended up walking over 100 blocks (from LES to Harlem) with all of my luggage to find a hostel. It was quite an adventure.</p>
      <p>I went to NYU and got my Bachelor's degree in Physics Education, 7-12. I ended up student teaching at East Side Community High School in 2015. Lucky for me, my mentor teacher was transitioning to a new career and recommended I take his job.</p>

<!--       Experience and Pedagogy -->
      <h2>Experience and Pedagogy</h2>
      <p>I have been teaching at East Side for 7 years since 2015. I started as a 12th grade advisor, teaching Physics. The next year, I added Engineering (Arduinos and Environmental Sustainability) to the list. In my fourth year, they asked me to teach 9th grade Science, so I moved to the 9th grade world, while still teaching one section of 12th grade Physics. I took a leave for a year to travel and teach abroad, when the pandemic hit. Knowing that this was a challenging time for the East Side Community, there was no where else I'd rather be than with this community. They needed support in the math department, so I taught Algebra with Latisha. Finally, I fully transitioned into the Computer Science world and officially became the coding teacher. Now, I spend my time learning and teaching coding, Physics, running a 12th grade advisory, and advising two clubs (Asian Student Association and Girls Who Code).</p>
      <p>I originally was certified to teach Physics 7-12 through NYU's Bachelor's program. During my first year of teaching, I learned about Arduinos and the amazing feeling of creation through physical computing. Every year, I fine tuned my circuits and coding curriculum, and found great success with many students. Most of them have never been exposed to coding before, and were pleasantly surprised to find themselves not only writing code, but enjoying it. Many students have told me that they have left feeling inspired to continue learning coding and pursuing a career in electrical engineering.</p>
      <p>These interactions and experiences have led me to refocus my teaching career on helping expose and prepare students for a career in Computer Science. I believe that many people don't try it because they aren't aware of what it is, what it makes them capable of, and how enjoyable it is. My goal as a Computer Science teacher is to expose as many students possible to computer science, especially to underrepresented demographics. I think this is especially important considering I teach many students from low-income backgrounds who struggle to find a job. This skill is becoming more and more important in the work place and it will only help their prospects by being knowledgeable.</p>

<!--       Current Life -->
      <h2>Current Life</h2>
      <p>I really love to travel. I've been to Europe, Asia, Central America, South America, and Africa. I have family in China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. My aunt is from Japan and my sister-in-law is from South Africa. I love my family - they crack me up so much.</p>
      <p>Most recently, I have been interested in <i>astrotourism</i> - traveling the world to observe the best phenomena in the sky, such as meteor showers or the Northern Lights!</p>

<p>I lived in almost every borough (sorry Staten Island) at some point. I moved a lot. Finally I'm in Jersey City with my dog named Nyla.</p>
